play2-strava
============================

**WIP** - a library for working with the Strava v3 API using the Play Framework's JSON and WS libraries.


### Installation

Bring in the library by adding the following to your ```build.sbt```. 

  - The release repository: 

```
   resolvers ++= Seq(
     "Millhouse Bintray"  at "http://dl.bintray.com/themillhousegroup/maven"
   )
```
  - The dependency itself: 

```
   libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
     "com.themillhousegroup" %% "play2-strava" % "0.4.30"
   )

```
